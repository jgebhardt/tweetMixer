tweetMixer/Babbly takes tweets tagged with #MHD11, speaks them to files via 'say'. The tweets are looped simultaneously in a Browser. You can control the volume of each tweet with good old midi hardware, sending control messages to the html5/jQuery interface via socket.io.

This is just a quick hack, so don't expect anything big :)
